## Challenges and Solutions 🧠
1. Real-time Communication: Implementing real-time video conferencing and chat can be challenging due to synchronization and latency issues.
    Solution: Use a reliable third-party library or service for real-time communication, such as WebRTC for video conferencing and Firebase Realtime Database for chat. Test and optimize network and data synchronization to minimize latency.
2. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Developing both mobile and web versions of the application can be challenging, as each platform has its own set of requirements and    limitations.
    Solution: Leverage Flutter for mobile app development to achieve cross-platform compatibility. Ensure responsive design for the web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Test thoroughly on different browsers and devices.
3. User Experience (UX): Creating an intuitive and user-friendly UI for both mobile and web can be demanding.
    Solution: Invest in UX/UI design, conduct user testing, and gather feedback to refine the interface. Follow platform-specific design guidelines for mobile and web to ensure a familiar and enjoyable experience.

## Future Enhancements 🚧
Screen Sharing: Implement screen sharing capabilities to allow presenters to share their screens during meetings, enhancing collaboration and presentation capabilities.
Recording Meetings: Provide the option to record meetings for later reference or sharing. Store recorded meetings securely in Firebase Cloud Storage.
Polls and Surveys: Integrate a polling and survey feature to engage participants and gather feedback during meetings and webinars.
Virtual Whiteboard: Add a virtual whiteboard for real-time drawing and annotation during meetings, which can be especially useful for educational purposes.
Breakout Rooms: Implement breakout rooms to allow participants to split into smaller groups for discussions or collaborative activities during larger meetings.
